Patriot. was a final project for the Intro to Internet Technology course that my friends and I worked on together during the second semester, which focused on front-end web development. The main purpose of this website was to provide education and understanding about the history of Indonesian heroes during the Dutch and Japanese colonial periods, as well as post-independence Indonesia. The features on this website included:

- Menu: Allows users to easily explore home, penjajahan belanda, penjajahan jepang, kemerdekaan, and quiz options.
- Heroes: Displays several lists of heroes from the Dutch and Japanese colonial periods and post-independence Indonesia. Additionally, it includes biographies for each hero and a button that links to Wikipedia.
- Quiz: Allows users to take quizzes about the history of Indonesian heroes.
- Responsive: Optimized for both mobile and desktop use, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.

Overall, Patriot. was an exciting project that allowed me to gain experience in front-end web development, enhanced my teamwork skills, and expanded my knowledge about the history of Indonesian heroes.
